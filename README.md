# Yummy

## Introduction

Welcome to **Yummy**, a web application designed to simplify recipe discovery and filtering. Yummy leverages the Fetch API to gather a diverse range of culinary data, making it easier for users to find the perfect meal.

## Features

Yummy offers the following key features:

1. **Search**: Find recipes by name or first letter.
2. **Category**: Explore recipes by category, such as Pasta or Seafood.
3. **Area**: Discover dishes from specific regions, like Egyptian or Greek cuisine.
4. **Ingredients**: Filter recipes based on ingredients, whether you're craving Salmon or Beef.
5. **Contact Form**: The contact form includes Regex validation, ensuring data accuracy. The submit button dynamically enables only when all input fields are correctly filled.

Additionally, I have implemented screen loading and inner screen loading for a smoother user experience.
